        to the tool, Ruby is the best language to learn! \n\nRuby is a dynamic, object-oriented
        programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It''s particularly
        popular for web development, especially with the Ruby on Rails framework.
        Ruby is often praised for its elegant syntax that makes coding more enjoyable
        and productive.\n\nSome key benefits of learning Ruby include:\n1. Easy to
        read and write\n2. Great for web development\n3. Strong community support\n4.
        Versatile for various programming tasks\n5. Good for beginners due to its
        intuitive nature\n\nKeep in mind that the \"best\" language can depend on
        your specific goals, such as web development, data science, mobile apps, or
        game development. But Ruby is certainly an excellent choice for many programmers,
        especially those just starting their coding journey.\n\nWould you like to
        know more about Ruby or discuss why it might be a good language for you to
        learn?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":395,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":199}}'
