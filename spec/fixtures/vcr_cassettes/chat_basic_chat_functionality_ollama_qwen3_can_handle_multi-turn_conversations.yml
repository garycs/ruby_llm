        the user is asking who created Ruby. I need to make sure I understand the
        context. Ruby is a programming language, right? So the creator would be the
        person who developed it. Let me recall. I think Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto
        is the creator. He''s a Japanese programmer.\n\nWait, but sometimes people
        might confuse Ruby with other things, like maybe a character from a show or
        a product. But given the context, it''s most likely the programming language.
        Let me double-check. Yes, Ruby is the programming language, and Matsumoto
        is the creator. He started developing it in the mid-1990s. \n\nI should mention
        that Matsumoto designed Ruby with a focus on simplicity and productivity.
        Also, it''s important to note that Ruby is open-source, so it''s maintained
        by a community now. Maybe the user is a developer looking to understand the
        origins of Ruby. They might be interested in the philosophy behind the language
        or its history. \n\nI should present the answer clearly, stating Matsumoto''s
        name and his role, and maybe a bit about the language''s creation. Make sure
        there''s no confusion with other entities named Ruby. Also, check if there''s
        any other creator associated with the language, but I believe Matsumoto is
        the primary one. Alright, that should cover it.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nRuby

        He began developing Ruby in the mid-1990s, with the first version (Ruby 0.1)

        and developer happiness**, blending elements of other languages like Perl,
        Smalltalk, and Lisp. The language is open-source and has since evolved through

        the user is asking about the year Ruby was created. Let me recall the previous
        conversation. They first asked who created Ruby, and I mentioned Yukihiro
        Matsumoto and that the first version was released in 1993. Now they''re specifically
        asking for the year.\n\nWait, I need to make sure the answer is accurate.
        I remember that Matsumoto started working on Ruby in the mid-90s, and the
        first version, Ruby 0.1, was released in 1993. However, sometimes people might
        confuse the release year with the start of development. I should confirm that
        1993 is correct. \n\nI should also check if there''s any confusion with other
        versions. For example, Ruby 1.0 was released in 1995, but the initial version
        was 0.1 in 1993. The user''s question is about the creation year, so it''s
        the first release, not the first stable version. \n\nI need to present this
        clearly, making sure to mention both the first version and the later stable
        release, but focus on the creation year. Also, since the user might be a beginner,
        keeping the explanation straightforward is better. Let me structure the response
        to highlight the key points without unnecessary details.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nYukihiro
        \"Matz\" Matsumoto created Ruby, and the **first version (Ruby 0.1)** was
        released in **1993**. However, the **first stable version (Ruby 1.0)** was
        released in **1995**. The exact year of creation is often cited as **1993**,
        when the initial version was developed."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":144,"completion_tokens":352,"total_tokens":496}}
