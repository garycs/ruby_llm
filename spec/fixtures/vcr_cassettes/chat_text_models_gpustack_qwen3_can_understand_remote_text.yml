        `license.txt` file contains the **license terms** for **Ruby**, a programming
        language created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz). Here''s a breakdown of its
        contents:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Points of the License**\n1. **Copyright & Redistribution**  \n   -
        Ruby is free software, and you can redistribute it **verbatim** (unchanged)
        **without restriction**, provided you retain all original copyright notices
        and disclaimers.\n\n2. **Modification Rights**  \n   If you modify the software,
        you must do **at least one** of the following:  \n   - **a)** Share your modifications
        freely (e.g., via Usenet, public repositories, or include them in the software).  \n   -
        **b)** Use the modified software only within your organization.  \n   - **c)**
        Label non-standard binaries with instructions to get the original source.  \n   -
        **d)** Make other arrangements with the author (Matz).\n\n3. **Binary Distribution**  \n   If
        distributing compiled binaries or object code, you must do **at least one**
        of:  \n   - **a)** Include instructions to get the original source.  \n   -
        **b)** Provide machine-readable source code with the distribution.  \n   -
        **c)** Label non-standard binaries with instructions to get the original source.  \n   -
        **d)** Arrange other terms with the author.\n\n4. **Integration with Other
        Software**  \n   You can modify and integrate Ruby into other software (even
        commercial), **except** for certain files not written by Matz. Check the `LEGAL`
        file for details on those files.\n\n5. **Scripts & Library Files**  \n   Scripts
        or files generated as input/output by Ruby (e.g., generated code) are **not
        automatically copyrighted** by Ruby. They belong to their creators and can
        be used commercially.\n\n6. **Disclaimer**  \n   The software is provided
        **\"as is\"** with **no warranties** (explicit or implied), including fitness
        for a particular purpose.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Notes**\n- The license
        is based on the **2-clause BSDL** (Berkeley Software Distribution License),
        which is similar to the BSD license.  \n- Refer to the `BSDL` file for the
        full text of the 2-clause license.  \n- For details on files not under these
        terms, consult the `LEGAL` file in the distribution.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nThis
        license allows **free use, modification, and distribution** of Ruby under
        specific conditions, with clear disclaimers and requirements for redistribution.
        It emphasizes freedom for users while reserving rights for the original author.","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1754832473,"id":"chatcmpl-AAJBV9WaJu4WVGWtxdlHCWhbNykE4jlB","model":"qwen3","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":866,"completion_tokens_details":{"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"reasoning_tokens":330,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"draft_tokens":0,"draft_tokens_acceptance":0.0,"prompt_tokens":544,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":12},"prompt_tokens_per_second":3807.151005325812,"time_per_output_token_ms":10.007784064665127,"time_to_first_token_ms":142.889,"tokens_per_second":99.92221989788318,"total_tokens":1410}}'
