        in France and serves as the country''s political, cultural, and economic center.
        It has been the capital since 1944 after its liberation, though historically
        it became the capital first in 508 under King Clovis and was reaffirmed as
        the capital under King Philippe Auguste between 1180 and 1223[1][3][4]. Paris
        is known globally as the \"City of Light\" due to its historical role in the
        Enlightenment and early adoption of street lighting, as well as being a major
        hub for fashion, arts, commerce, and gastronomy[2][3][5].\n\nWith a population
        of about 2 million in the city proper and over 12 million in the greater \u00cele-de-France
        region, Paris is one of Europe''s largest metropolitan areas and one of the
        world''s most important cities[1][3]."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content":
