        the user provided a license.txt file content and is asking what''s in it.
        Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nFirst, the file
        mentions Ruby is copyrighted free software by Yukihiro Matsumoto. Then it
        lists terms under different clauses. The first clause allows redistribution
        and modification with certain conditions. Clause 2 talks about modifying the
        software and requires one of the options a to d. Clause 3 is about distributing
        in binary form with similar options. Clause 4 mentions including parts of
        the software in other software but notes some files aren''t under these terms
        and refers to a LEGAL file. Clause 5 states that scripts and library files
        aren''t automatically under the copyright. Finally, clause 6 is the standard
        \"AS IS\" disclaimer.\n\nI need to summarize the key points. The license is
        a combination of the 2-clause BSD license and some additional conditions.
        It allows redistribution and modification but with specific requirements.
        The user might be trying to understand the licensing terms for using Ruby,
        possibly for a project. They might need to know if they can use it in their
        software, modify it, or distribute it. They might also be concerned about
        the exceptions for certain files and the LEGAL file reference. I should explain
        each clause briefly, highlight the key permissions and restrictions, and mention
        the references to BSDL and LEGAL files. Also, note that it''s a permissive
        license but with specific conditions, especially regarding modifications and
        distribution.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nThe `license.txt` file contains the licensing
        terms for **Ruby**, a programming language developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto
        (Matz). Here''s a breakdown of its key points:\n\n---\n\n### **License Overview**\n-
        **Type**: A combination of the **2-clause BSD license** and **custom conditions**
        specific to Ruby.\n- **Author**: Yukihiro Matsumoto (`matz@netlab.jp`).\n-
        **Permissions**: Allows redistribution, modification, and use under specific
        conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Provisions**\n1. **Redistribution (Clause
        1)**  \n   - You can freely copy and distribute the source code, provided
        you retain original copyright notices and disclaimers.\n\n2. **Modification
        (Clause 2)**  \n   If you modify the software, you must do **one of these**:\n   -
        Publish your changes in the Public Domain or share them freely (e.g., via
        Usenet).\n   - Use the modified software only within your organization.\n   -
        Rename non-standard binaries and provide instructions to get the original
        source.\n   - Make other arrangements with the author.\n\n3. **Binary Distribution
        (Clause 3)**  \n   If distributing binaries, you must do **one of these**:\n   -
        Include instructions to get the original source.\n   - Provide machine-readable
        source code.\n   - Rename non-standard binaries and include instructions.\n   -
        Make other arrangements with the author.\n\n4. **Integration with Other Software
        (Clause 4)**  \n   - You can modify and integrate Ruby into other software
        (even commercial), **but**:\n   - Some files in the distribution are **not
        under these terms** (check the `LEGAL` file for details).\n\n5. **Scripts
        and Library Files (Clause 5)**  \n   - Files generated as input/output by
        Ruby (e.g., scripts) are **not automatically copyrighted** by Ruby. They belong
        to the creator and can be sold or used commercially.\n\n6. **Disclaimer (Clause
        6)**  \n   - The software is provided **\"as-is\"** with **no warranties**
        (explicit or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose).\n\n---\n\n###
        **Important Notes**\n- **BSDL Reference**: The license is based on the **2-clause
        BSD license** (see the `BSDL` file for details).\n- **LEGAL File**: Some files
        in the Ruby distribution have **different licensing terms** (e.g., third-party
        libraries). Check the `LEGAL` file for specifics.\n- **Permissive License**:
        While permissive, it includes **specific conditions** for modification and
        distribution, especially for binaries and non-standard use cases.\n\n---\n\n###
        **When to Use This**\nThis license allows **free use, modification, and redistribution**
        of Ruby, but you must comply with the conditions (e.g., retaining notices,
        handling modifications, or providing source code for binaries). Always check
        the `LEGAL` file for exceptions or additional restrictions."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":544,"completion_tokens":893,"total_tokens":1437}}
