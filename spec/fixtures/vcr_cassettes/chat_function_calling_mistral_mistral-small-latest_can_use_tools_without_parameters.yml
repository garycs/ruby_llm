        best language to learn can depend on various factors such as your goals, interests,
        and the current demand in the job market. However, here are a few languages
        that are highly recommended for different purposes:\n\n1. **For Web Development**:
        JavaScript, Python, and Ruby are excellent choices. JavaScript is essential
        for front-end development, while Python and Ruby are popular for back-end
        development.\n\n2. **For Data Science and Machine Learning**: Python is currently
        the most popular language in this field due to its simplicity and the availability
        of numerous libraries and frameworks.\n\n3. **For Mobile App Development**:
        Swift (for iOS) and Kotlin (for Android) are the preferred languages.\n\n4.
        **For Enterprise Applications**: Java and C# are widely used in large-scale
        enterprise environments.\n\n5. **For System Programming**: C and C++ are still
        the go-to languages for system/software development, game development, and
        operating systems.\n\n6. **For Beginners**: Python and Ruby are known for
        their easy-to-read syntax, making them great for beginners.\n\n7. **For General-Purpose
        Programming**: Python, JavaScript, and Java are versatile and can be used
        for a wide range of applications.\n\nIf you have a specific goal in mind,
        please let me know, and I can provide a more tailored recommendation."}}]}'
