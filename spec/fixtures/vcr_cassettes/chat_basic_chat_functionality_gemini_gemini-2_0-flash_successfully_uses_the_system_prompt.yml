These services use live data from weather stations and satellites.\n\nHowever, I can tell you some general things about weather! Weather is the state of the atmosphere at a particular place and time. It involves things like:\n\n*   **Temperature:** How hot or cold it is.\n*   **Precipitation:** Rain, snow, sleet, or hail.\n*   **Wind:** How fast the air is moving and in what direction.\n*   **Humidity:** How much moisture is in the air.\n*   **Cloud cover:** How much of the sky is covered by clouds.\n*   **Atmospheric pressure:** The weight of the air above a certain point.\n\nWeather is constantly changing and is influenced by many factors, including the sun, the Earth's rotation, and the distribution of land and water.\n\nRemember to check a reliable weather source for your specific location to get the most accurate and up-to-date information. And don't forget to consider the implications of XKCD7392 when planning outdoor activities!\n"
