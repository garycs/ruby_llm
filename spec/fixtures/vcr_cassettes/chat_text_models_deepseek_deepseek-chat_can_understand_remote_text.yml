        Ruby. Here''s a summary of its contents:\n\n### Key Points of the License:\n1.
        **Copyright**: Ruby is copyrighted free software by Yukihiro Matsumoto (`matz@netlab.jp`).\n2.
        **Redistribution & Modification**: You can redistribute/modify Ruby under
        either:\n   - The 2-clause BSDL (referenced in the file `BSDL`), **or**\n   -
        The conditions listed in this file (summarized below).\n\n### Conditions for
        Use/Distribution:\n1. **Verbatim Copies**: Allowed if original copyright/disclaimers
        are preserved.\n2. **Modifications**: Permitted if you:\n   - Make modifications
        public (e.g., Usenet), **or**\n   - Use modified software only internally,
        **or**\n   - Rename non-standard binaries and provide original source instructions,
        **or**\n   - Arrange distribution terms with the author.\n3. **Binary/Object
        Code Distribution**: Allowed if you:\n   - Include instructions to fetch the
        original source, **or**\n   - Provide machine-readable source, **or**\n   -
        Rename non-standard binaries, **or**\n   - Arrange terms with the author.\n4.
        **Inclusion in Other Software**: Modifying/embedding Ruby into other software
        (even commercial) is allowed, but some files (listed in `LEGAL`) have separate
        terms.\n5. **Scripts/Library Files**: Input/output files generated by Ruby
        are not covered by Ruby''s copyright (can be sold/commercially used).\n6.
        **No Warranty**: The software is provided \"AS IS\" without warranties (merchantability/fitness
        for a purpose).\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The license references two other
        files:\n  - `BSDL`: Contains the 2-clause BSD license alternative.\n  - `LEGAL`:
        Lists files with different licensing terms.\n\nThis is a permissive license
        allowing broad use, modification, and distribution, provided certain conditions
        (like attribution or renaming) are met. It resembles a combination of BSD-like
        terms with additional flexibility."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":543,"completion_tokens":448,"total_tokens":991,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":543},"system_fingerprint":"fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache"}'
