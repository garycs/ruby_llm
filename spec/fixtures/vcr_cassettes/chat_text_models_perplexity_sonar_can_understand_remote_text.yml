        of the source, preserving copyright notices and disclaimers.\n- Modifications
        are allowed if at least one condition is met, such as making modifications
        public, limiting use to an organization, renaming binaries with instructions,
        or arranging distribution with the author.\n- Distribution in binary or object
        code form is allowed with conditions similar to those for source distribution.\n-
        Parts of the software not authored by Matz may have different terms (listed
        in a separate LEGAL file).\n- Scripts and libraries produced by the software
        are not automatically covered by this license and can be sold or aggregated
        separately.\n- The license disclaims all warranties, including implied warranties
        of merchantability and fitness.\n\nThis license is designed to be free and
        permissive, allowing broad use and modification, with some conditions to preserve
        attribution and control distribution methods. It is historically linked to
        Ruby''s licensing and offers a choice between this license and the BSD license
        for redistribution[1][2]."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
